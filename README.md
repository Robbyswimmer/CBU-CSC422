## Coding Assignment Schedule

### Week 1 – Coding Assignment 1 (CLO 5)
Implement a simple linear regression in Python to predict housing prices and reflect on how ML differs from traditional programming.

### Week 3 – Coding Assignment 2 (CLO 1)
Train and evaluate logistic regression and decision tree classifiers on a labeled dataset, comparing accuracy and interpretability.

### Week 4 – Coding Assignment 3 (CLOs 2, 3)
Experiment with model validation using cross-validation and visualize bias-variance tradeoffs on overfit vs. underfit models.

### Week 5 – Coding Assignment 4 (CLOs 2, 3)
Apply k-means clustering and PCA to an unlabeled dataset and analyze cluster quality and dimensionality reduction results.

### Week 6 – Coding Assignment 5 + Midterm Project (CLOs 2, 4)
Build a shallow neural network (MLP) from scratch with numpy to classify data, then launch the midterm ML project using shallow learning methods.

### Week 7 – Coding Assignment 6 (CLO 4)
Train a convolutional neural network in TensorFlow or PyTorch on an image dataset (MNIST/CIFAR-10) and visualize learned filters.

### Week 8 – Coding Assignment 7 (CLO 4)
Implement an RNN or LSTM to model sequential data (e.g., text or time series) and analyze how hidden states capture temporal dependencies.

### Week 9 – Coding Assignment 8 (CLO 4)
Train a simple GAN on MNIST to generate new images and evaluate output quality with visual inspection and metrics like FID.

### Week 10 – No Coding Assignment (Zybooks Only)
Focus on reading and discussion of transformer models and fine-tuning methods.

### Week 11 – Coding Assignment 9 (CLO 4)
Implement Q-learning in a simple environment (e.g., Gridworld) and extend it with reward shaping or policy evaluation.

### Week 12 – Coding Assignment 10 (CLOs 2–5)
Submit a project-progress Colab notebook demonstrating dataset preparation, baseline model results, and planned experiments for the final project.

### Week 14 – Final Project Deliverables (CLOs 2–5)
Deliver a complete deep learning project (report, code, and presentation) that applies advanced ML/DL methods to a novel problem.
