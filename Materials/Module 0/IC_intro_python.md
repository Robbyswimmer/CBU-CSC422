# Phase 1: Python Foundations Review (12 minutes)
**Goal: Refactor naive loops into concise, reusable functions**

## Opening Hook (2 minutes)

**TALKING POINTS:**
• Loops work, but they don't scale
• Let's go from functional but clunky to elegant and powerful
• We are doing this because we will be using Python to solve real data problems efficiently

```python
# Challenge: How would you calculate the square of every even number from 1 to 20?
# Naive solution: repetitive and verbose
squares = []
for i in range(1, 21):
    if i % 2 == 0:
        squares.append(i**2)
print(squares)
```

**TALKING POINTS:**
• works but verbose, doesn't scale to large datasets
• by end of class, this becomes one elegant line
• data processing efficiency matters in ML
• "Let's build the foundation for better solutions"

## Variables & Modern String Formatting (3 minutes)

**TALKING POINTS:**
• Show how f-strings replace outdated concatenation
• Emphasize readability, type safety, and performance benefits
• Connect to data science: clean output is crucial for analysis
• Key takeaway: prefer f-strings for fast, maintainable string formatting

```python
# Modern Python - f-strings are your best friend
name = "Alice"
score = 95.7
attempts = 3

# Old way (don't do this)
print("Student " + name + " scored " + str(score) + " in " + str(attempts) + " attempts")

# New way (much cleaner!)
print(f"Student {name} scored {score} in {attempts} attempts")

# f-strings with formatting
print(f"Student {name} scored {score:.1f}% in {attempts} attempts")
print(f"That's a {score/100:.2%} success rate!")
```

**Talking Points:**
• Highlight automatic type conversion in f-strings
• Explain performance benefits (compile-time optimization)
• Show formatting syntax: .1f for decimals, .2% for percentages

## Control Flow with Data (4 minutes)

**Talking Points:**
• Introduce realistic student data scenario
• Emphasize this mirrors actual course data processing
• Set up pattern recognition for data transformation tasks
• Preview how basic approaches don't scale well

**DEMO PROGRESSION:**
• Present concrete example with actual test scores
• Show traditional manual counting approach
• Introduce function-based processing for reusability
• Build toward more sophisticated techniques

```python
# Working with data lists
test_scores = [85, 92, 78, 96, 88, 91, 73]

# Traditional approach
passed_students = 0
for score in test_scores:
    if score >= 80:
        passed_students += 1
print(f"Students passed: {passed_students}")

# Let's also categorize grades
def categorize_grade(score):
    if score >= 90:
        return "A"
    elif score >= 80:
        return "B"
    elif score >= 70:
        return "C"
    else:
        return "F"

# Apply to our scores
for score in test_scores:
    grade = categorize_grade(score)
    print(f"Score {score} = Grade {grade}")
```

**Talking Points:**
• Point out meaningful variable naming practices
• Explain separation of concerns (logic vs processing)
• Highlight function reusability benefits
• Discuss scalability problems with manual approaches

## Functions for Data Processing (3 minutes)

```python
# Useful utility functions you'll use constantly
def calculate_statistics(numbers):
    """Calculate basic stats for a list of numbers."""
    if not numbers:
        return None
    
    total = sum(numbers)
    count = len(numbers)
    average = total / count
    
    return {
        'count': count,
        'sum': total,
        'average': average,
        'min': min(numbers),
        'max': max(numbers)
    }

# Test it out
stats = calculate_statistics(test_scores)
print(f"Class statistics: {stats}")

# Multiple return values (very useful!)
def get_min_max(numbers):
    return min(numbers), max(numbers)

min_score, max_score = get_min_max(test_scores)
print(f"Range: {min_score} to {max_score}")
```

**💬 "Functions are building blocks. Now let's see data structures that will change how you think about data..."**

# Phase 2: Data Structures & Comprehensions (15 minutes)
**Goal: Transform messy student data with elegant one-liners**

## Lists Deep Dive (4 minutes)

**TALKING POINTS:**
• Review slicing, membership, and indexing with student data examples
• Show real-world data manipulation scenarios
• Key takeaway: lists are Python workhorses, but scale better with advanced techniques

```python
# Lists are your data workhorses
students = ["Alice", "Bob", "Carol", "David", "Eve"]
scores = [85, 92, 78, 96, 88]

# Powerful slicing
print(f"Top 3 students: {students[:3]}")
print(f"Last 2 scores: {scores[-2:]}")
print(f"Every other student: {students[::2]}")

# List operations that save time
all_data = students + scores  # Concatenation
repeated = [0] * 10  # Create list of zeros

# Check membership (fast!)
if "Alice" in students:
    print("Alice is in the class")

# Get index position
alice_position = students.index("Alice")
alice_score = scores[alice_position]
print(f"Alice's score: {alice_score}")
```

## List Comprehensions - The Game Changer! (6 minutes)

**💬 THE BIG REVEAL:**
• Circle back to opening challenge - deliver on the promise
• Emphasize this is the most important Python skill for data science
• Build excitement - this is where Python becomes "magical"
• Position as transformation from beginner to intermediate Python

**PATTERN BREAKDOWN:**
• Show the 5-line solution vs 1-line solution side by side
• Break down comprehension syntax: [expression for item in iterable if condition]
• Explain each component with hands-on typing
• Emphasize readability despite compactness

```python
# Remember our challenge from the beginning?
# Traditional way
squares = []
for i in range(1, 21):
    if i % 2 == 0:
        squares.append(i**2)

# List comprehension way - ONE LINE!
squares = [i**2 for i in range(1, 21) if i % 2 == 0]
print(f"Squares of even numbers: {squares}")
```

**💬 COMPREHENSIVE EXAMPLES:**
• Start with simple transformations, build complexity
• Use student grade examples to maintain context
• Show filtering, mapping, and conditional logic
• Demonstrate string processing applications
• Include advanced nested comprehensions for ambitious students

```python
# More examples - this will blow your mind
original_scores = [85, 92, 78, 96, 88, 91, 73]

# Convert to letter grades in one line!
letter_grades = ['A' if score >= 90 else 'B' if score >= 80 else 'C' if score >= 70 else 'F' 
                for score in original_scores]
print(f"Letter grades: {letter_grades}")

# Get only passing scores
passing_scores = [score for score in original_scores if score >= 80]
print(f"Passing scores: {passing_scores}")

# Apply a curve (add 5 points to each)
curved_scores = [score + 5 for score in original_scores]
print(f"Curved scores: {curved_scores}")

# Work with strings
student_names = ["alice smith", "bob jones", "carol williams"]
proper_names = [name.title() for name in student_names]
print(f"Proper names: {proper_names}")

# Nested comprehensions (for advanced data)
matrix = [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, 9]]
flattened = [num for row in matrix for num in row]
print(f"Flattened matrix: {flattened}")
```

**💬 TEACHING STRATEGY:**
• Type each example live, explaining logic as you go
• Point out how each replaces 3-5 lines of traditional code
• Emphasize performance benefits (C-speed under the hood)
• Connect to data science: "You'll use this in every assignment"
• Address common mistakes: syntax, readability balance
• Preview how this works with NumPy arrays later

```python
# Dictionaries for key-value relationships
students = ["Alice", "Bob", "Carol", "David", "Eve"]
scores = [85, 92, 78, 96, 88]

# Traditional way to create student-score pairs
student_grades = {}
for i in range(len(students)):
    student_grades[students[i]] = scores[i]

# Dictionary comprehension way!
student_grades = {students[i]: scores[i] for i in range(len(students))}
print(f"Student grades: {student_grades}")

# Even better with zip()
student_grades = {name: score for name, score in zip(students, scores)}
print(f"Using zip: {student_grades}")

# Filter dictionary items
high_achievers = {name: score for name, score in student_grades.items() if score >= 90}
print(f"High achievers: {high_achievers}")

# Transform values
curved_grades = {name: score + 5 for name, score in student_grades.items()}
print(f"Curved grades: {curved_grades}")
```

## Working with Real Data Structures (2 minutes)

```python
# Real-world data often looks like this
student_data = [
    {"name": "Alice", "score": 85, "age": 20, "major": "CS"},
    {"name": "Bob", "score": 92, "age": 19, "major": "Math"},
    {"name": "Carol", "score": 78, "age": 21, "major": "Physics"},
    {"name": "David", "score": 96, "age": 20, "major": "CS"}
]

# Extract just names using comprehension
names = [student["name"] for student in student_data]
print(f"Names: {names}")

# Find CS majors
cs_students = [student["name"] for student in student_data if student["major"] == "CS"]
print(f"CS majors: {cs_students}")

# Calculate average age of high scorers
high_scorers = [student for student in student_data if student["score"] >= 90]
avg_age = sum(student["age"] for student in high_scorers) / len(high_scorers)
print(f"Average age of high scorers: {avg_age:.1f}")
```

high_scores = list(filter(lambda x: x >= 90, scores))
print(f"High scores: {high_scores}")

# Use with enumerate and zip
names = ["Alice", "Bob", "Carol", "David"]
for i, (name, score) in enumerate(zip(names, scores)):
    print(f"{i+1}. {name}: {score}")
```

## Error Handling (1.5 minutes)

**TALKING POINTS:**
• Show try-except blocks for graceful error management
• Demonstrate specific exception handling vs generic catching
• Introduce context managers for automatic resource cleanup
• Connect to robust data processing where failures are expected

```python
def safe_divide(a, b):
    try:
        result = a / b
        return result
    except ZeroDivisionError:
        print("Cannot divide by zero!")
        return None
    except TypeError:
        print("Both arguments must be numbers!")
        return None

# Test error handling
print(safe_divide(10, 2))    # Works fine
print(safe_divide(10, 0))    # Handles division by zero
print(safe_divide(10, "a"))  # Handles type error

# File handling with context managers
def read_data_file(filename):
    try:
        with open(filename, 'r') as file:
            data = file.read()
            return data
    except FileNotFoundError:
        print(f"File {filename} not found!")
        return None

# The file automatically closes even if an error occurs
```

## Import Strategies and Best Practices (1.5 minutes)

**TALKING POINTS:**
• Show standard import aliases and naming conventions in data science
• Demonstrate selective importing to avoid namespace pollution
• Show useful collections module tools for specialized data structures
• Connect to professional coding standards and maintainable project structure

```python
# Good import practices
import numpy as np              # Standard alias
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt # Standard alias
from collections import defaultdict, Counter

# Avoid: from numpy import *  (clutters namespace)
# Good: import specific functions you need
from math import sqrt, pi, sin, cos

# Example: using defaultdict for counting
text = "hello world hello python world"
word_counts = defaultdict(int)
for word in text.split():
    word_counts[word] += 1

print(f"Word counts: {dict(word_counts)}")

# Counter makes it even easier
from collections import Counter
word_counts = Counter(text.split())
print(f"Using Counter: {word_counts}")

# Code organization tips
def main():
    """Main function - entry point of your program."""
    print("Running main program...")
    
    # Your main logic here
    data = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
    result = process_data(data)
    print(f"Result: {result}")

def process_data(data):
    """Process data using the techniques we learned."""
    # Use comprehensions
    processed = [x**2 for x in data if x % 2 == 0]
    
    # Use NumPy
    np_data = np.array(processed)
    
    return np_data.mean()

# Run only if this script is executed directly
if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

## Session Wrap-up and Challenge

**THE GRAND FINALE:**
• Bring together every technique from the session
• Show realistic data science workflow from start to finish
• Demonstrate how advanced Python handles complex problems elegantly
• Build confidence for upcoming course assignments

**CHALLENGE SETUP:**
• Present raw CSV-style data (common in real work)
• Walk through data processing pipeline step by step
• Highlight which techniques solve which problems
• Show how everything connects to form powerful workflows

```python
# FINAL CHALLENGE: Process student data using all techniques
import numpy as np
from collections import defaultdict

# Raw data (like you might get from a CSV file)
raw_student_data = [
    "Alice,85,90,88,CS",
    "Bob,78,85,82,Math", 
    "Carol,95,97,94,Physics",
    "David,88,91,87,CS",
    "Eve,92,89,93,Math"
]

# Process using everything we learned:

# 1. Parse data using comprehensions
students = []
for line in raw_student_data:
    parts = line.split(',')
    name = parts[0]
    scores = [int(parts[i]) for i in range(1, 4)]  # Comprehension!
    major = parts[4]
    students.append({"name": name, "scores": scores, "major": major})

print("Parsed student data:")
for student in students[:2]:  # Show first 2
    print(f"  {student}")

# 2. Use NumPy for calculations
all_scores = np.array([student["scores"] for student in students])
print(f"Score matrix shape: {all_scores.shape}")

# Calculate weighted averages using @
weights = np.array([0.4, 0.35, 0.25])  # Homework, Quiz, Exam
final_grades = all_scores @ weights

# 3. Add final grades back to student data
for i, student in enumerate(students):
    student["final_grade"] = final_grades[i]

# 4. Use lambda and built-ins for analysis
# Top performers
top_students = sorted(students, key=lambda s: s["final_grade"], reverse=True)[:3]
print(f"\nTop 3 students:")
for student in top_students:
    print(f"  {student['name']}: {student['final_grade']:.1f}")

# 5. Group by major using defaultdict
by_major = defaultdict(list)
for student in students:
    by_major[student["major"]].append(student["final_grade"])

print(f"\nAverage by major:")
for major, grades in by_major.items():
    avg = np.mean(grades)
    print(f"  {major}: {avg:.1f}")

# 6. Final statistics
print(f"\nClass statistics:")
print(f"  Class average: {np.mean(final_grades):.1f}")
print(f"  Standard deviation: {np.std(final_grades):.1f}")
print(f"  Grade range: {np.min(final_grades):.1f} - {np.max(final_grades):.1f}")
```

**Talking Points:**
• Point out each technique used in the solution
• Count the lines of code vs traditional approach
• Emphasize readability and maintainability
• Connect to upcoming assignments: "You now have the tools"
• Celebrate the transformation from basic to advanced Python
• Preview how these skills enable machine learning success

## Quick Reference Card

### Essential Patterns to Remember:

```python
# List comprehensions
result = [expression for item in iterable if condition]

# Dictionary comprehensions  
result = {key_expr: value_expr for item in iterable}

# NumPy operations
array1 @ array2           # Matrix multiplication
array[array > value]      # Boolean indexing
np.mean(array, axis=0)    # Operations along axes

# Class template
class MyClass:
    def __init__(self, param):
        self.param = param
    
    def method(self):
        return self.param

# Error handling
try:
    risky_operation()
except SpecificError:
    handle_error()
```

## What's Next?

**These Python techniques will power everything we do in this course:**
- **Data loading and preprocessing** - comprehensions and NumPy
