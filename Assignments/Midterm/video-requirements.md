- **Screen Issues**: Text too small to read or poor resolution

### Time Management Issues
- **Overrun**: Exceeding 10-minute maximum
- **Undertime**: Not reaching 5-minute minimum
- **Imbalanced**: Spending too much time on setup vs. results
- **No Buffer**: Not leaving time for technical issues

## Tips for Success

### Preparation
1. **Script Outline**: Write key points but don't read verbatim
2. **Practice**: Rehearse multiple times, time yourself
3. **Test Setup**: Check all technical aspects before recording
4. **Backup Plan**: Have contingency for technical failures

### Recording Best Practices
1. **Environment**: Quiet space with good lighting
2. **Multiple Takes**: Record sections separately if needed
3. **Backup Audio**: Consider separate audio track
4. **File Management**: Save frequently and have backups

### Content Strategy
1. **Audience Focus**: Present to your classmates, not the instructor
2. **Story Arc**: Create narrative that builds understanding
3. **Visual Priority**: Show, don't just tell
