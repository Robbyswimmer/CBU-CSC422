# Midterm Project Proposal

**Assignment Weight**: 2 points  
**Due Date**: 10/03

## Overview

Before beginning implementation of your midterm project, you must submit a comprehensive project proposal that demonstrates thoughtful planning and ensures your chosen approach is feasible and appropriately scoped for this course. This proposal serves as a "contract" between you and the instructor, establishing clear expectations and allowing for early feedback and course correction if needed.

## Purpose and Learning Objectives

By completing this proposal, you will:
- Articulate a clear, well-motivated research question
- Demonstrate understanding of dataset requirements and limitations
- Plan appropriate shallow learning techniques for your problem type

- Evaluation metrics are appropriate for the problem type
- Validation strategy follows best practices

### 4. Implementation Plan & Timeline (0.5 points)

**Length**: ~0.5 pages

**Required Content**:
- **Week-by-Week Breakdown**: Specific tasks aligned with course milestones
- **Risk Assessment**: What could go wrong and how will you address it?
- **Backup Plans**: Alternative approaches if your primary plan fails
- **Resource Requirements**: Software, computational resources, time estimates
- **Repository Structure**: Planned organization of your GitHub repository

**Required Timeline Alignment**:
- Week 3: Dataset selected, initial exploration (this proposal due)
- Week 4: EDA complete, preprocessing pipeline established
- Week 5: Models implemented and evaluated
- Week 6: Final submission due (repository + video)

**Evaluation Criteria**:
- Timeline is realistic and aligned with course milestones
- Demonstrates awareness of potential challenges
- Shows evidence of contingency planning
- Repository structure follows project specifications

## Evaluation Rubric

**Total Points: 2**

| Component | Excellent (Full Points) | Good (75%) | Satisfactory (50%) | Needs Improvement (25%) |
|-----------|-------------------------|------------|-------------------|-------------------------|
| **Problem Statement** (0.5 pts) | Clear, specific, well-motivated research question with measurable success criteria | Good problem definition with minor clarity issues | Basic problem statement but lacks specificity or motivation | Vague or poorly defined problem |
| **Dataset Analysis** (0.5 pts) | Thorough analysis with proper attribution, quality assessment, and strong justification | Good dataset choice with adequate exploration | Basic dataset description meets requirements | Poor dataset choice or insufficient analysis |
| **Technical Approach** (0.5 pts) | Well-planned approach with appropriate techniques, metrics, and validation strategy | Good technical plan with minor gaps | Basic approach but some techniques may be suboptimal | Poor technique selection or unrealistic approach |
| **Implementation Plan** (0.5 pts) | Realistic timeline with risk assessment and backup plans | Good planning with some contingency thinking | Basic timeline meets milestones | Unrealistic timeline or no risk consideration |

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

### Content Issues
- **Vague Problem Statements**: "I want to analyze data" is not specific enough
- **Inappropriate Datasets**: Choosing datasets too simple, too complex, or with licensing issues
- **Unrealistic Scope**: Proposing projects that are too ambitious for the time frame
- **Missing Baselines**: Forgetting to plan a meaningful comparison baseline

### Technical Issues
- **Wrong Algorithm Choice**: Selecting techniques inappropriate for the problem type
- **No Evaluation Plan**: Failing to specify how you'll measure success
- **Ignoring Data Quality**: Not addressing obvious data quality issues
- **Poor Timeline**: Creating unrealistic implementation schedules

### Presentation Issues
- **Informal Writing**: Using casual language instead of professional academic tone
- **Missing Citations**: Failing to properly attribute dataset sources
- **Poor Organization**: Not following the required section structure
- **Length Issues**: Significantly over or under the 2-3 page requirement

## Getting Help

### Before You Submit
- **Dataset Selection**: Post in discussion forum for feedback on dataset appropriateness
- **Scope Questions**: Email instructor if unsure about project complexity
- **Technical Approach**: Use office hours to discuss algorithm selection
- **Writing Support**: Utilize campus writing center for document review

### After Proposal Submission
- **Instructor Feedback**: You will receive feedback within one week of submission
- **Revision Opportunity**: Minor adjustments to approach are expected based on feedback
- **Implementation Support**: Continue using office hours and discussion forums during implementation

## Success Strategies

1. **Start Early**: Begin dataset exploration before writing the proposal
2. **Be Specific**: Avoid vague language - demonstrate concrete understanding
3. **Stay Realistic**: Choose projects you can complete well rather than overly ambitious ones
4. **Plan for Problems**: Every project encounters obstacles - show you've thought ahead
5. **Seek Feedback**: Discuss your ideas with classmates and instructor before submitting

## Connection to Main Project

This proposal directly supports your success on the main midterm project (worth 10 points) by:
- Ensuring you choose an appropriate and feasible project scope
- Identifying potential issues before implementation begins
- Creating a roadmap for efficient implementation
- Establishing clear success criteria and evaluation metrics

Students who submit thoughtful, well-planned proposals typically produce higher-quality final projects and experience fewer implementation difficulties.

Remember: The goal is not to have a perfect plan that never changes, but to demonstrate thoughtful preparation and realistic understanding of the challenges ahead. Your actual implementation may evolve from this proposal based on what you discover during the process - and that's perfectly normal and expected in data science work.
