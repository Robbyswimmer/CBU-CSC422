## Additional Grading Notes

### Video Presentation Impact
While the video presentation is evaluated separately (see [Video Requirements](video-requirements.md)), exceptional communication of technical concepts may result in bonus consideration for borderline grades.

### Late Submission Policy
- 1-24 hours late: -10% penalty
- 24-48 hours late: -20% penalty  
- More than 48 hours late: -50% penalty
- More than 1 week late: 0 points (without approved extension)

### Academic Integrity
- All code must be original work or properly attributed
- Dataset usage must comply with licensing terms
- Collaboration policy: Individual work required, but dataset/approach discussions encouraged

### Resubmission Policy
Students may resubmit within one week of grade return for up to 80% credit if initial submission scored below 7/10 points.

## Grade Scale
- **A (9-10 points)**: Exceeds expectations in most areas
- **B (7-8 points)**: Meets expectations with solid execution  
- **C (5-6 points)**: Meets basic requirements with room for improvement
- **D (3-4 points)**: Below expectations, missing key components
- **F (0-2 points)**: Unsatisfactory work or major components missing

## Instructor Comments
Individual feedback will be provided for each rubric category, highlighting strengths and specific areas for improvement in preparation for the final project.
