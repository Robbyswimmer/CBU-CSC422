# CSC 422 Midterm Project

## Overview

The midterm project is your opportunity to **"get your hands dirty with a dataset"** and apply the shallow learning techniques we've covered in the first 5 weeks of class. This project serves as the foundation for deeper work in your final project.

**Worth**: 10 points  
**Due**: Week 6  
**Track**: Track 1 (Structured Learning Path)

## Key Philosophy

> *"Apply what you've learned in class with shallow models."*

This project emphasizes practical application of fundamental machine learning concepts using traditional (non-deep learning) approaches including linear regression, logistic regression, SVM, decision trees, and clustering algorithms.

## Assignment Files

- **[Project Specification](midterm-project-specification.md)** - Complete project requirements and guidelines
- **[Grading Rubric](rubric.md)** - Detailed evaluation criteria (10 points total)
- **[Video Requirements](video-requirements.md)** - Guidelines for your 5-10 minute presentation

## Deliverables

1. **GitHub Repository** - Clean, runnable code with README
2. **Video Presentation** - 5-10 minute explanation of your work

## Timeline

- **Week 2**: Track decision deadline
- **Week 3**: Project brainstorming begins
- **Week 6**: Midterm project due

## Technical Requirements

- Use an online dataset (Kaggle, UCI ML Repository, government data, etc.)
- Implement at least one baseline model + one shallow ML model
- Focus on classification, regression, or clustering problems
- Ensure full reproducibility from a clean repository clone

## Support

- **Office Hours**: Check course calendar for availability
- **Discussion Forum**: Use for technical questions and dataset suggestions
- **Email**: [rmoseley@calbaptist.edu](mailto:rmoseley@calbaptist.edu) for individual concerns

## Getting Started

1. Review the [Project Specification](midterm-project-specification.md)
2. Browse suggested datasets and select your problem
3. Set up your GitHub repository
4. Begin with exploratory data analysis
5. Implement baseline and ML models
6. Record your presentation video
