# Module 2: Classification and Logistic Regression

**Course:** CSC 422 - Machine and Deep Learning  
**Duration:** Week 3-4  
**Difficulty:** Beginner to Intermediate

## üìö Module Overview

This module transitions from regression to classification problems, introducing logistic regression as a fundamental classification algorithm. Students will learn to work with categorical data, understand probability-based prediction, and implement classification models from scratch.

## üéØ Learning Goals

By the end of this module, you will be able to:

- [ ] Distinguish between regression and classification problems
- [ ] Understand the logistic function and its properties
- [ ] Implement logistic regression from scratch using Python and NumPy
- [ ] Apply classification algorithms to real-world datasets
- [ ] Evaluate classification models using appropriate metrics
- [ ] Handle binary and multi-class classification scenarios
- [ ] Understand decision boundaries and probability thresholds

## üìñ Topics Covered

### Core Concepts
- **Classification Problems** - Binary vs multi-class classification
- **Logistic Regression** - From linear to logistic regression
- **Sigmoid Function** - Mapping outputs to probabilities
- **Decision Boundaries** - Separating classes in feature space

### Mathematical Foundations
- **Log-Odds and Logit** - Understanding the logistic transformation
- **Maximum Likelihood Estimation** - Parameter estimation for classification
- **Cross-Entropy Loss** - Cost function for classification problems
