- Good technical progress with mostly working implementations
- Some preliminary results or findings
- Organized repository with adequate documentation
- Shows technical development and learning
- Generally appropriate technology choices

**Satisfactory (0.3 pts)**
- Basic technical implementation but may have significant gaps
- Limited or unclear preliminary results
- Repository exists but organization or documentation is lacking
- Some technical progress but limited problem-solving demonstrated
- Technology choices may not be optimal

**Needs Improvement (0.2 pts)**

- Limited technical growth or problem-solving evident
- Poor technology choices

**Unsatisfactory (0 pts)**
- No meaningful technical implementation
- No working code or evidence of technical work
- No repository or completely disorganized materials

## Additional Considerations

### Bonus Considerations (No additional points, but noted for feedback)
- Exceptional problem-solving or creativity in addressing challenges
- Strong integration of feedback from original proposal
- Clear evidence of independent learning and skill development
- Professional presentation and communication quality

### Common Issues to Avoid
- **Progress Inflation**: Overstating accomplishments without concrete evidence
- **Scope Avoidance**: Failing to address obvious timeline or feasibility issues
- **Technical Stagnation**: Showing no meaningful code development or experimentation
- **Resource Neglect**: Ignoring original research or failing to seek new sources
- **Planning Paralysis**: Creating unrealistic expectations for remaining time

## Grading Scale
- **2.3-2.5 points**: Excellent progress, well-positioned for successful completion
- **2.0-2.2 points**: Good progress with minor adjustments needed
- **1.7-1.9 points**: Satisfactory progress but some concerns about final delivery
- **1.4-1.6 points**: Progress concerns requiring significant course correction
- **Below 1.4 points**: Serious progress issues requiring immediate intervention

## Feedback Format
Students will receive:
- Overall score and grade
- Specific feedback for each criterion with actionable recommendations
- Identification of strengths and areas needing immediate attention
- Specific suggestions for successful project completion
- Approval status for continuation or required modifications

## Connection to Final Project Success
This checkpoint serves as a critical intervention point to ensure students:
- Have made sufficient progress to complete their projects successfully
- Identify and address potential obstacles before they become project-ending issues
- Receive targeted feedback to optimize their final three weeks of work
- Maintain realistic expectations and scope for their final deliverables

Students who receive strong checkpoint evaluations typically demonstrate significantly better final project outcomes and report higher satisfaction with their learning experience.
