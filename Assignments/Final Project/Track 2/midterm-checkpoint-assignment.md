# Track 2: Midterm Project Checkpoint

## Assignment Overview
This midterm checkpoint serves as a critical progress evaluation and course-correction opportunity for your semester-long Track 2 final project. You will submit a comprehensive progress report that demonstrates your accomplishments to date and presents a refined plan for completing your project successfully.

## Learning Objectives
By completing this checkpoint, you will:
- Reflect critically on your project progress and identify areas needing adjustment
- Demonstrate substantive progress toward your final project goals
- Refine your project timeline based on actual implementation experience
- Receive targeted feedback to ensure successful project completion

## Assignment Requirements

### 1. Progress Summary & Achievements (0.5 page)
- **Work Completed**: Detailed summary of what you have accomplished since your initial proposal
- **Milestones Achieved**: Specific deliverables completed from your original timeline
- **Technical Implementation**: Overview of code, models, experiments, or research conducted
- **Key Learnings**: Important insights, discoveries, or lessons learned during implementation

### 2. Resource Utilization & Findings (0.25 page)
- **Resource Application**: How you have used the sources identified in your original proposal
- **New Resources**: Additional sources, tools, or references you have discovered and incorporated
- **Gap Analysis**: Areas where additional resources or research are needed
- **Technical Challenges**: Obstacles encountered and how they were addressed

### 3. Updated Project Plan & Timeline (0.5 page)
- **Revised Timeline**: Updated weekly plan for the remaining 3 weeks based on current progress
- **Scope Adjustments**: Any changes to project scope, goals, or deliverables with justification
- **Risk Mitigation**: Identified risks and specific strategies to address them
- **Final Sprint Planning**: Detailed plan for weeks 8-10 leading to project completion

### 4. Technical Progress Demonstration (0.25 page)
- **Implementation Status**: Current state of your technical implementation
- **Preliminary Results**: Any initial findings, model performance, or experimental outcomes
- **Code Repository**: Link to your current code repository with evidence of active development
- **Next Technical Steps**: Specific technical tasks planned for project completion

## Submission Guidelines
- **Format**: PDF document, 1-2 pages (excluding references and appendices)
- **Font**: 12pt Times New Roman or similar, single-spaced
- **Margins**: 1-inch margins on all sides
- **File Naming**: `<LastNames>_Track2_Checkpoint.pdf`
- **Due Date**: Week 7 (specific date on course calendar)
- **Submission Platform**: Upload to course management system

## Required Deliverables
Along with your written report, you must also submit:
1. **Updated Project Repository**: GitHub/GitLab link showing active development
2. **Progress Artifacts**: Screenshots, preliminary visualizations, or prototype demonstrations
3. **Resource Bibliography**: Updated list of sources and references being used

## Evaluation Criteria
This assignment is worth **2.5 points** and will be evaluated based on:
- **Progress Demonstration** (0.75 pts): Evidence of substantial work completed toward project goals
- **Resource Integration** (0.5 pts): Effective use of identified sources and adaptation to new findings
- **Timeline Management** (0.75 pts): Realistic assessment of progress and appropriate timeline adjustments
- **Technical Development** (0.5 pts): Clear evidence of technical implementation and problem-solving

## Success Indicators
**Strong submissions will demonstrate:**
- Substantial progress on project implementation with concrete deliverables
- Thoughtful reflection on lessons learned and challenges encountered
- Realistic and well-justified adjustments to original project plans
- Clear evidence of active technical development (code commits, experiments, etc.)
- Professional presentation with specific, measurable progress indicators

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid
- **Vague Progress Reports**: "I made good progress" without specific details
- **Unrealistic Timeline Adjustments**: Not accounting for time needed for testing, documentation, and presentation preparation
- **Ignoring Resource Gaps**: Failing to identify areas where additional research or tools are needed
- **Minimal Technical Evidence**: Not providing concrete evidence of implementation progress

## Connection to Final Submission
This checkpoint directly supports your final project success by:
- Ensuring you are on track for timely completion
- Identifying potential issues while there is still time to address them
- Providing opportunity for instructor feedback and guidance
- Establishing realistic expectations for final deliverables

## Getting Help
- **Technical Issues**: Use office hours to discuss implementation challenges
- **Scope Concerns**: Email instructor if considering significant project changes
- **Resource Needs**: Post in discussion forum for suggestions on additional sources
- **Timeline Stress**: Reach out early if you are falling behind schedule

Remember: The goal is honest assessment and proactive planning, not perfection. This checkpoint is designed to help you succeed on your final project, so be specific about both accomplishments and challenges.
