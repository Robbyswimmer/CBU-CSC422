## Additional Considerations

### Bonus Considerations (No additional points, but noted for feedback)
- Creativity and innovation in project concept
- Demonstration of independent thinking
- Clear writing and professional presentation
- Appropriate use of domain-specific terminology

### Common Issues to Avoid
- **Scope Creep**: Projects that are too ambitious for 10 weeks
- **Vague Descriptions**: Using general terms without specific details
- **Unrealistic Timelines**: Not accounting for learning curves and obstacles
- **Poor Resource Selection**: Choosing irrelevant or low-quality sources
- **Technology Mismatch**: Selecting tools that don't fit the project needs

## Grading Scale
- **1.8-2.0 points**: Excellent work, ready to proceed with confidence
- **1.6-1.7 points**: Good work with minor revisions needed
- **1.4-1.5 points**: Satisfactory work, some concerns about feasibility
- **1.0-1.3 points**: Needs improvement, significant revisions required
- **Below 1.0 points**: Unsatisfactory, must resubmit

## Feedback Format
Students will receive:
- Overall score and grade
- Specific feedback for each criterion
- Suggestions for improvement or refinement
- Approval status for project continuation
