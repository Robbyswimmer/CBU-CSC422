# Track 2 Project Proposal Assignment

## Assignment Overview
This assignment requires you to submit a comprehensive 2-3 page project proposal for your semester-long independent research project. The proposal serves as your roadmap for the next 10 weeks and demonstrates your ability to plan, design, and execute a substantial machine learning or AI project.

## Learning Objectives
By completing this assignment, you will:
- Develop project planning and technical design skills
- Learn to identify and evaluate relevant resources for your project
- Create realistic timelines with concrete milestones
- Design appropriate technical approaches and select suitable technologies

## Assignment Requirements

### 1. Project Concept & Main Idea (0.5-1 page)
- **Clear Project Description**: What problem are you solving or what question are you exploring?
- **Motivation & Goals**: Why is this project important or interesting? What do you hope to achieve?
- **Project Type**: Clearly indicate whether this is an academic research project or an applied/industry-focused project
- **Expected Impact**: What will this project contribute to the field or how will it be useful?

### 2. Relevant Resources & Background (0.5 page)
- **Academic Projects**: Include 3-5 relevant academic papers, research articles, or technical reports
- **Applied Projects**: Include relevant industry resources, technical blogs, documentation, tutorials, or case studies
- **Brief Analysis**: For each resource, provide 1-2 sentences explaining how it relates to your project
- **Gap Identification**: What existing work are you building upon, and what new contribution will you make?

### 3. 10-Week Execution Plan (0.5-1 page)
Create a detailed weekly timeline with specific milestones:
- **Weeks 1-2**: Project setup, environment configuration, initial data collection/exploration
- **Weeks 3-4**: Baseline implementation, preliminary experiments
- **Weeks 5-6**: Core development phase, first iteration of main approach
- **Week 7**: Midterm checkpoint - progress evaluation and course correction
- **Weeks 8-9**: Advanced implementation, optimization, experimentation
- **Week 10**: Final testing, documentation, presentation preparation

Each week should have:
- Specific deliverables
- Key milestones to achieve
- Potential risks and mitigation strategies

### 4. Technical Approach & Design (0.5 page)
- **Guiding Technical Ideas**: What are the core technical concepts or methods you'll use?
- **Methodology**: How will you approach the problem? What algorithms or techniques will you employ?
- **Data Strategy**: What data will you use? How will you collect, process, and validate it?
- **Evaluation Metrics**: How will you measure success and progress?

### 5. Technology Stack & Tools (0.25 page)
- **Programming Languages**: Python, R, JavaScript, etc.
- **Frameworks & Libraries**: TensorFlow, PyTorch, scikit-learn, etc.
- **Development Tools**: Jupyter notebooks, VS Code, Git, etc.
- **Infrastructure**: Cloud platforms (AWS, Google Cloud), local hardware, etc.
- **Justification**: Brief explanation of why you chose these technologies

### 6. Expected Outcomes & Success Criteria (0.25 page)
- **Primary Deliverables**: What will you produce? (model, application, research findings, etc.)
- **Success Metrics**: How will you know if your project succeeded?
- **Potential Challenges**: What obstacles do you anticipate and how will you address them?

## Submission Guidelines
- **Format**: PDF document, 2-3 pages (excluding references)
- **Font**: 12pt Times New Roman or similar, single-spaced
- **Margins**: 1-inch margins on all sides
- **File Naming**: `<Group_Members>_Track2_Proposal.pdf`
- **Due Date**: September 19, 2025, 11:59 PM
- **Submission Platform**: Upload to Blackboard

## Evaluation Criteria
This assignment is worth **2 points** and will be evaluated based on:
- **Project Concept & Clarity** (0.5 pts): Well-defined idea with clear, achievable goals
- **Resource Identification** (0.5 pts): Relevant and appropriate sources that demonstrate understanding
- **10-Week Plan & Feasibility** (0.5 pts): Realistic timeline with concrete, measurable milestones
- **Technical Design** (0.5 pts): Sound technical approach with appropriate technology choices

## Tips for Success
- **Be Specific**: Avoid vague descriptions. Clearly define what you will build or investigate.
- **Be Realistic**: Ensure your project scope is appropriate for 10 weeks of work.
- **Show Research**: Demonstrate that you've investigated existing work in your area.
- **Plan for Setbacks**: Include buffer time and alternative approaches in your timeline.
- **Focus on Learning**: Remember that the goal is to learn and grow, not necessarily to solve the world's problems.

## Questions?
If you have questions about the assignment requirements or need clarification on any aspect of the proposal, please reach out during office hours or post in the course forum.

Good luck with your project planning!
