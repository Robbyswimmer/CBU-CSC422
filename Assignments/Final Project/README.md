# Final Project: Track 1 vs Track 2

## Overview
The final project component of CSC 422 offers two distinct paths to accommodate different learning styles and career goals. Students must choose their track by the end of Week 2.

## Track 1: Structured Learning Path
**Two Connected Projects (40 points total)**

### Midterm Project (10 points)
- *"Get your hands dirty with a dataset. Apply what you've learned in class with shallow models."*
- **Timeline**: Weeks 3-6
- **Focus**: Practical application of course concepts
- **Approach**: Guided implementation with clear requirements

### Final Project (30 points)  
- *"Build something deeper. Use advanced techniques like neural networks."*
- **Timeline**: Weeks 10-14
- **Focus**: Advanced ML/DL techniques
- **Approach**: Building upon midterm foundations

**Characteristics:**
- Scaffolded learning with progressive complexity
- Clear milestones and structured guidance
- Two manageable projects with defined scope
- Ideal for students who prefer step-by-step progression

## Track 2: Independent Research
**Single Comprehensive Project (40 points total)**

### Research Project (40 points)
- *"Tackle a bigger, semi-open problem â€” exploratory, with either a research bent or applied AI innovation."*
- **Timeline**: Full semester (Weeks 3-14)
- **Focus**: Independent exploration and research
- **Approach**: Self-directed with minimal guidance

**Key Requirements:**
- **Week 3**: Project proposal submission (2 points)
- **Week 6**: Progress update checkpoint
- **Week 14**: Final presentation and deliverables

**Characteristics:**
- Higher expectations and standards
- More independent work and self-direction
- Single, comprehensive project with research depth
- Suitable for ambitious problems requiring extended exploration
- Ideal for students seeking research experience or tackling applied AI innovation

## Making Your Choice

### Choose Track 1 if you:
- Prefer structured learning with clear milestones
- Want to progressively build skills from basic to advanced
- Like having defined requirements and guidance
- Are new to ML/AI project work

### Choose Track 2 if you:
- Enjoy independent research and exploration
- Have a specific problem or idea you want to investigate
- Are comfortable with ambiguity and self-direction
- Want to pursue research-level or innovative applied work

## Important Notes
- **Decision Deadline**: End of Week 2
- **Both tracks are equally valuable** - choose based on your learning style and goals
- **No switching allowed** after the deadline
- Track 2 requires a project proposal (worth 2 points) due September 19, 2025
