# Track 1: Final Project Proposal

## Assignment Overview
This assignment requires you to submit a comprehensive 2-page project proposal for your independent final project. This project is completely separate from your midterm work and should demonstrate your ability to apply advanced machine learning and deep learning techniques to a new problem domain over the final 4 weeks of the semester.

## Learning Objectives
By completing this assignment, you will:
- Learn to design complete ML/DL projects that incorporate advanced techniques
- Develop skills in planning the implementation of complex algorithms from scratch
- Create realistic timelines for advanced technical implementation
- Identify appropriate learning resources and technical documentation for independent work

- Build initial model architecture and training pipeline
- Conduct initial training and testing
- Debug and refine implementation

**Week 12**: Model optimization and experimentation

- Experiment with different architectures or approaches
- Performance evaluation and iterative improvements
- Address any technical challenges

**Week 13**: Final development and evaluation
- Complete final model implementation and testing
- Comprehensive evaluation and performance analysis
- Documentation and code cleanup
- Prepare final presentation materials

Each week should include:
- Specific technical milestones
- Learning objectives and resources to study
- Potential challenges and backup plans

### 4. Learning Resources & Technical Documentation (0.25 page)
- **Primary Learning Materials**: List 3-4 key tutorials, courses, or documentation sources for your chosen techniques
- **Technical References**: Include relevant technical papers, blog posts, or implementation guides
- **Framework Documentation**: Specific documentation for the libraries/frameworks you'll use
- **Community Resources**: Forums, GitHub repositories, or Stack Overflow discussions that will support your learning

### 5. Expected Deliverables & Success Criteria (0.25 page)
- **Primary Deliverables**: 
  - Complete ML/DL project implementing advanced techniques
  - Comprehensive evaluation and performance analysis
  - Clean, documented code with clear implementation
  - Final presentation demonstrating project capabilities

- **Success Metrics**: 
  - Successful implementation of at least one advanced technique
  - Quantitative performance results on chosen problem domain
  - Clear demonstration of learning and technical growth
  - Functional end-to-end implementation

- **Minimum Viable Product**: What is the minimum acceptable outcome if you encounter significant challenges?

- **Stretch Goals**: What additional features or techniques would you implement if time permits?

## Submission Guidelines
- **Format**: PDF document, exactly 2 pages
- **Font**: 12pt Times New Roman or similar, single-spaced
- **Margins**: 1-inch margins on all sides
- **File Naming**: `<LastName_FirstName>_Track1_FinalProposal.pdf`
- **Due Date**: [Insert Date], 11:59 PM
- **Submission Platform**: Upload to Blackboard

## Evaluation Criteria
This assignment is worth **2 points** and will be evaluated based on:
- **Project Concept & Problem Definition** (0.5 pts): Clear problem statement with well-defined goals and appropriate advanced techniques
- **Technical Implementation Plan** (0.5 pts): Sound technical approach with realistic implementation strategy
- **Implementation Timeline** (0.5 pts): Realistic 4-week plan with concrete milestones and learning objectives
- **Resources & Deliverables** (0.5 pts): Appropriate learning materials and clear success criteria

## Tips for Success
- **Choose Appropriately**: Select advanced techniques that are suitable for your chosen problem domain
- **Plan for Learning**: Budget time to learn new concepts and debug implementations
- **Start Simple**: Begin with basic implementations before attempting complex optimizations
- **Document Everything**: Keep detailed notes on your learning process and implementation decisions
- **Be Realistic**: Choose a problem scope that is achievable in 4 weeks while still being challenging

## Project Independence
This final project should be completely independent from your midterm work. Your proposal should demonstrate:
- A fresh problem domain or application area
- New technical challenges that require advanced ML/DL solutions
- Independent thinking and project design skills
- Ability to tackle complex problems from scratch
