## Additional Considerations

### Bonus Considerations (No additional points, but noted for feedback)
- Creativity in problem selection and technical approach
- Demonstration of strong technical understanding and growth mindset
- Clear and professional writing with appropriate technical terminology
- Realistic self-assessment of current skills and learning needs

### Common Issues to Avoid
- **Scope Mismatch**: Choosing advanced techniques that are too complex or too simple for 4 weeks
- **Poor Project Planning**: Not considering all aspects needed to build a complete project from scratch
- **Unrealistic Learning Curves**: Underestimating time needed to learn new concepts
- **Vague Technical Descriptions**: Using general terms without demonstrating understanding
- **Timeline Optimism**: Not accounting for debugging, optimization, and learning time

## Grading Scale
- **1.8-2.0 points**: Excellent work, ready to proceed with confidence
- **1.6-1.7 points**: Good work with minor adjustments needed
- **1.4-1.5 points**: Satisfactory work, some concerns about feasibility or technical approach
- **1.0-1.3 points**: Needs improvement, significant revisions required before proceeding
- **Below 1.0 points**: Unsatisfactory, must resubmit with major changes

## Feedback Format
Students will receive:
- Overall score and grade
- Specific feedback for each criterion
- Technical guidance and suggestions for improvement
- Approval status for final project continuation
- Recommendations for learning resources or timeline adjustments if needed

## Track 1 Specific Notes
- Focus should be on designing and implementing a completely new project independent of midterm work
- Advanced techniques should be appropriate for the chosen problem domain and achievable in 4 weeks
- Timeline should account for both learning advanced concepts and complete implementation from scratch
- Success should be measured based on successful implementation and learning demonstration, not research-level innovation
